# Debt Collector

### First , so to speak, finished project.
  * Backend: nodeJS & express,
  * UI: Mustache.js (used to create HTML components, stored inside main html, had no knowledge bundling tools like webpack or parcel. Later tried to change it by sending according templates through backend),
  * Real-time DOM updates: Socket.io.
  
###### Decided to drop it to not dwell on this one for too long. Current github version isn't live on heroku.
