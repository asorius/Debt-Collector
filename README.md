First , so to speak, finished project. Used nodeJS and express on backend. handlebars used to create html components, stored inside main html, had no knowledge bundling tools like webpack or parcel. Later tried to change it by sending according templates through backend. For no window reload content refresh used socket.it actions. Decided to drop it to not dwell on this one for too long.
